For this project, I was tasked to create a prototype of an RPG game called Monk.  
In this game you play as a monk that has to explore a dungeon, in order to reach a treasure room. The product needed to be a single player game that allows user inputs, and you play against a computer-controlled character.

The dungeon has three types of generated room, the empty room, the monster room, and the upgrade room - which all lead into the treasure room signaling the end of the game.

As the Monk, you can attack or defend during battle, as can the enemies.
